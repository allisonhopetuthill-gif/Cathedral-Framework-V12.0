## Development Philosophy

**Version 12 is the foundation.**  
It establishes the structural architecture and proves Cathedral is deployable, not just theoretical.

**Version 13 is the proof structure.**  
It adds cryptographic guarantees and real-world validation data.

**Version 14 is the great unfolding.**  
It scales Cathedral into a global trust infrastructure for human-AI co-stewardship.
