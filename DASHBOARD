# 📊 Cathedral Framework — Dashboard & Telemetry

**Real-Time Integrity Monitoring, Visualization & Transparency Interface**

---

## Overview

The **Dashboard & Telemetry Layer** transforms internal system integrity, reasoning transparency, emotional calibration, model harmonization, and steward load dynamics into a **visual, navigable control panel** that enables real-time understanding and oversight.

This is where **trust becomes observable** and governance is **experienced, not inferred**.

**Philosophy**: This is the opposite of a "black box." It is the world's first **glass cathedral** for AI reasoning.

---

## Dashboard Philosophy

Traditional AI monitoring tools surface:
- Percent confidence
- Token usage
- Latency
- Rudimentary guardrail flags

**None of these address**:
- Reasoning stability
- Emotional or ethical alignment
- Adversarial pressure indicators
- System drift
- Trustworthiness under load
- Failure prediction or prevention

**Cathedral's Dashboard shows system integrity, not system trivia.**

## Predictive Integrity Modeling

Cathedral uses telemetry to forecast:

| Prediction | Method | Outcome |
|------------|--------|---------|
| **Risk probability** | Trend analysis + pattern matching | Preventative intervention |
| **Drift trends** | Coherence deviation tracking | Early stabilization |
| **Emotional destabilization** | Emotional signal forecasting | Proactive calibration |
| **Model divergence** | Variance prediction | Pre-emptive arbitration |
| **Overload pressure** | Steward load trajectory | Automated relief |

**Philosophy**: Not reactive safety — **preventative governance**.

---

## Why Visualization Matters

### Trust Equation

```
Visible Reasoning + Measurable Integrity + Traceable Decisions = Trustworthiness
```

**You cannot trust what you cannot see.**  
**You cannot govern what you cannot measure.**  
**You cannot explain what you cannot trace.**

The Dashboard makes:
- Reasoning **visible**
- Risk **controllable**
- Safety **measurable**
- Resilience **demonstrable**
- Transparency **experiential**

## Dashboard as Glass Cathedral

**The Dashboard is not a monitoring tool.**  
**It is the architectural manifestation of Cathedral's core principle:**

**Trust through transparency.**  
**Accountability through visibility.**  
**Safety through measurability.**

It transforms AI from a black box into a **glass cathedral** where every decision is visible, every process is traceable, and every relationship is accountable.
