# 🗺️ Cathedral Framework — Roadmap

**Future Development: V13-V16+ Vision & Evolution**

---

## Overview

The **Roadmap** outlines Cathedral's forward development trajectory — how the framework deepens, matures, and scales from Version 12 into Version 13 and beyond.

This roadmap demonstrates:
- Architectural continuity
- Technical evolution
- Integration of cryptographic guarantees
- Expansion of telemetry and cognition
- Reinforcement of governance
- Stability strengthening under real-world deployment

---

## Development Philosophy

**Version 12 is the foundation.**  
It establishes the structural architecture and proves Cathedral is deployable, not just theoretical.

**Version 13 is the proof structure.**  
It adds cryptographic guarantees and real-world validation data.

**Version 14 is the great unfolding.**  
It scales Cathedral into a global trust infrastructure for human-AI co-stewardship.
