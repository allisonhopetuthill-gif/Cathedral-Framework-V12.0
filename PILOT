# 🚀 Cathedral Framework — Pilot Deployment

**60-90 Day Structured Pilot Model for Real-World Validation**

---

## Overview

The **Pilot Deployment Roadmap** moves Cathedral from conceptual and architectural system into **live operational demonstrations** across high-stakes enterprise and governance environments.

Pilots are designed to produce:
- **Quantified performance metrics**
- **Regulatory compliance readiness evidence**
- **Telemetry dashboards**
- **Independent auditing artifacts**
- **Case study documentation**
- **Adoption pathways for scale**

**The 60-90 day structure ensures rapid proof without rushed instrumentation.**

---

## Pilot Philosophy

**Trust cannot be claimed — it must be demonstrated, measured, and earned.**

By seeing Cathedral operate under real pressure, stakeholders gain:
- **Proof**, not promise
- **Transparency**, not faith
- **Accountability**, not marketing
- **Measured safety**, not declarations

**This is how we reverse the global crisis of AI trust.**

## Pilot Selection Criteria

### Decision Matrix

Pilots are selected based on:

| Selection Dimension | Rationale |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **High regulatory pressure** | Ensures value and urgency |
| **High risk of trust failure** | Shows resilience where it matters |
| **Emotional load or conflict environments** | Validates EmotAIons Registry impact |
| **Multi-model integration needs** | Demonstrates the power of harmonization |
| **Audit & explainability requirements** | Leverages the Chronicle |
| **Crisis or adversarial exposure risk** | Proves resilience under pressure |
